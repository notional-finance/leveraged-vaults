# Are liquidations failing? Check these things:
# Datadog Dashboard: https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/4kr-s7n-9nv/v3-risk-monitoring
#  1. Are there sufficient funds on the relayer? (0x745915418D8B70f39ce9e61A965cBB0C87f9f7Ed)
#  2. Are any of the liquidator addresses above holding a position in the vault?
#  3. Do you need to increase the gas limit?

# Setup:
# 1. When running in Brownie, you need to comment out one of the contracts/global/*/Deployments.sol files. It does
#    not matter which one as long as you are not deploying new contracts. (during liquidation you are not).
# 2. Ensure your hot wallet is loaded into the brownie account store:
#       `brownie accounts new <YOUR_WALLET_NAME>`
# 3. View the liquidation calldata at one of these URLs:
#       - https://arbitrum.vault-liquidator.notional.finance/<VAULT_ADDRESS>
#       - https://mainnet.vault-liquidator.notional.finance/<VAULT_ADDRESS>

    # Unlock your account here:
    # accounts.load("<YOUR_WALLET_NAME>")

    # Choose a liquidator (any one will do) and decode the inputs:
    # liquidators[0].decode_input("<CALLDATA_FROM_BATCHES>")[1]
    # Make sure you extract the array from the output and put quotes around the byte string

    # Copy these args and execute:
    # liquidators[0].flashLiquidate(<ARGS_FROM_OUTPUT>)

    # Alternatively, you can copy the "batchArgs" and then update them as you see fit,
    # perhaps increasing the flash loan amount or reducing the number of accounts
    # being liquidated.
    
    # WARNING: you cannot liquidate two accounts with different maturities in one batch,
    # you will need to use two liquidator contracts or wait the 1 minute exit vault time
    # between liquidation contracts.
